        <p> I found a cool API that simulates a card deck so I decided to make a relativly simple blackjack api.</p>
        <p> The API returns a random card, so I made it when you click the "deal button" it grabs 4 cards, and store them either as dealer card or player card</p>
        <p> Then when you hit it will pull another request and add it up with your current cards When you stand it will show the dealer card, and caluclate the winner</p>
        <p> I think API's are super cool, I have used them for a lot of other classes, mostly in python, but transfering those skills to this isnt too hard</p>
        <p> There are alot of ways I could use and API for the other project. Youtube has an API so I can maybe do something with user input, and have it request a video, </p>
        <p> and try and find a way to embed it into the website as a built in viewer. Youtube is still able to count these views and such so it shouldnt take away anything from the creator. </p>
